Phase 1: Architecture Design

-Requirements Analysis
-Service Decomposition
-Dependency Mapping
-Infrastructure Planning

Phase 2: MVP Development

-Foundation-First Development
-Iterative Integration Pattern
-Integration Testing Strategy

Phase 3: Integration & Testing

-End-to-End Validation
-Performance Validation
-Documentation Updates

Phase 4: Production Ready

-Security Hardening
-Performance Optimization
-Automation & Documentation

|       PHASE 1 : ARCHITECTURE DESIGN       |
---------------------------------------------

1.Requirements Analysis

-What services needed?
-How do services communicate?
-What data needs persistence?
-What are security requirements?

2.Service Decomposition

-Define exact responsibilities for each service
-Draw service boundaries (what each service does/doesn't do)
-Design APIs between services
-Identify shared resources (databases, volumes)
-Apply single responsibility principle
-Validate service separation makes sense

3.Dependency Mapping

-Identify which services need other services to function
-Create dependency diagram/chart
-Determine build order (which service to implement first)
-Find critical path for development
-Plan testing strategy based on dependencies
-Identify potential bottlenecks

4.Infrastructure Planning

-Choose technology stack (ex:Node.js vs Python vs Java)
-Design network architecture (how containers communicate)
-Plan data storage (volumes, databases)
-Design security setup (SSL, secrets, firewalls)
-Write docker-compose.yml skeleton
-Plan environment configuration (.env files)
-Design deployment strategy
